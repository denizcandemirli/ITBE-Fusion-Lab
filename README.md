1)Overal Software Implementation Setup
1.1)Overall Architecture of the Web Application:
The web application is locally hosted and built using Node.js along with various packages and frameworks such as Express.js for server-side development, Mongoose for MongoDB database integration, and npm for package management. Additionally, the application utilizes HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap), and JavaScript for front-end development, handles routing, and interacts with the MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
Packages Used:
•	Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
•	npm: A package manager for Node.js used to install and manage dependencies. 
•	Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js used to handle routing, middleware, and server logic. 
•	Mongoose: An object data modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js used to manage database interactions. 
•	Bootstrap: A front-end framework used for designing responsive websites.
•	Nodemon: A utility that monitors changes in the source code and automatically restarts the server during development, enhancing the developer experience.
•	API Keys: Advanced Bootstrap forms are integrated with API keys for digital participation and contact forms, allowing for secure and seamless communication between the web application and APIs.
